# Interactive Map of Cases and Deaths of COVID-19 in the U.S. Overtime. 
I created this map with Folium. It uses data from the COVID Tracking Project to create a bubble map overtime, tracking the number of new cases and deaths in each state and U.S. territory. The radius of the bubbles are population adjusted, but the numbers displayed in the popup are not adjusted. Because of the volume of data I can't display the map through jupyter notebook but have uploaded my python code for retrieving the data and creating the map.
